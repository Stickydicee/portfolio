🧪 Kali Linux VM Setup & Installation
=====================================

This folder contains a full guide on how I set up a Kali Linux virtual machine using VirtualBox on a Windows host.  
This project marks the start of my offensive security training lab.

The setup includes downloading the ISO, installing VirtualBox, creating the VM, allocating proper hardware, and running the graphical installer.
