## üîß Create Bootable USB with Rufus

Once both files were downloaded:

1. Inserted a USB flash drive (minimum 8GB recommended).
2. Opened **Rufus** and selected the correct USB device.
3. Clicked **SELECT** and chose the `proxmox-ve_9.0-1.iso` file.
4. Left all default options:
   - **Partition scheme**: GPT
   - **Target system**: UEFI (non-CSM)
   - **File system**: FAT32
   - **Cluster size**: 8192 bytes (default)
5. Pressed **START** and confirmed any prompts.

After a few minutes, the USB installer was successfully created and ready to use on bare-metal hardware.
