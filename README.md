# 👨🏽‍💻 Cybersecurity Portfolio - Nicky Jacobs

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio. My name is **Nicky Jacobs**, born in **Curaçao** and currently living in the **Netherlands**.

I value making good use of my time and consider myself an open-minded person. I enjoy doing meaningful and fun things like going to festivals with friends, grabbing drinks on a terrace, visiting museums and art galleries, and exploring new activities. I also love traveling, visiting new countries and continents to discover what more the world has to offer.

I love listening to music and I always enjoy a good film, series, or documentary. I like working out and I’m currently learning **Spanish**. Every day, I strive to become the best version of myself, mainly for myself, but also for the people who matter to me.

## My Passion for Cybersecurity

I'm deeply passionate about **IT**, especially **cybersecurity**. It’s something I invest a lot of time into and gladly so.

My favorite podcast is _Risky Business_ by Patrick Gray. I follow cybersecurity news via **WIRED**, **NCSC** and I also enjoy **Darknet Diaries**.

To build hands-on skills, I’ve developed a **homelab** and collected various tools and setups, including:
- A laptop with a **Kali Linux VM**
- **Flipper Zero** (with WiFi and Bluetooth add-ons)
- **WiFi Pineapple Mark VII Tactical** for WiFi pentesting
- Several bootable USBs with **Tails**, **Kali**, and **Parrot Security OS**

These have significantly improved my technical knowledge. You’ll find related projects in this portfolio. Some sections might not be fully up to date, but I do my best to keep everything centralized and documented here.

## Academic Background

I'm currently studying **Cybersecurity** at **Hogeschool NOVI** in the Netherlands. While I haven’t finished my degree yet, I’ve already gained valuable experience that extends beyond the technical layer.

In the **Security Orchestration (SOC)** module, I learned about:
- Organizational, tactical, and strategic approaches to security
- OSINT & HUMINT techniques
- Threat Intelligence and actor profiling
- Legal frameworks and compliance
- Security awareness campaigns
- and more

### Tools & Frameworks I've worked with:
- **Shodan**
- **Mitre ATT&CK**, **Cyber Kill Chain**, **Diamond Model**
- **RAVIB Methodology**, **SANS Maturity Model**, **ISO 27001**
- Various **vulnerability databases**
- and more

## Work Experience

I currently work as a **Security Analyst** in a **Security Operations Center (SOC)**, which gives me real-world experience alongside my studies and homelab projects.

I’m still exploring which path I want to follow in cybersecurity. On one side, I really enjoy the **technical aspect** and see myself growing into a **Red Team Pentester** or **Threat Hunter**. On the other hand, I’m also developing a strong interest in **Threat Intelligence** and long-term would love to work in a strategic role like **CISO**.

I’m still at the beginning of my career, and I’m okay with that. I’m here to learn, grow, and share my journey—step by step.
